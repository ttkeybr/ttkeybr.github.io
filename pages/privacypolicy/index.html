      <h1>Privacy policy</h1>

      <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At <em>keybr.com</em> we have a few fundamental principles:</p>

      <ul style="list-style: circle;">
        <li>We don&rsquo;t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
        <li>We don&rsquo;t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our
          products, or protect our rights.
        </li>
        <li>We don&rsquo;t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on&ndash;going operation
          of one of our services.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>

      <h3>Website Visitors</h3>

      <p>Like most website operators, <em>keybr.com</em> collects non&ndash;personally&ndash;identifying information of
        the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
        referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. <em>keybr.com&rsquo;s</em> purpose in collecting
        non&ndash;personally identifying information is to better understand how <em>keybr.com&rsquo;s</em> visitors use
        its website. From time to time, <em>keybr.com</em> may release non&ndash;personally&ndash;identifying
        information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

      <p><em>keybr.com</em> also collects potentially personally&ndash;identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
        addresses. <em>keybr.com</em> does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not
        disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
        personally&ndash;identifying information, as described below.</p>

      <h3>Gathering of Personally&ndash;Identifying Information</h3>

      <p>Certain visitors to <em>keybr.com&rsquo;s</em> websites choose to interact with <em>keybr.com</em> in ways that
        require <em>keybr.com</em> to gather personally&ndash;identifying information. The amount and type of
        information that
        <em>keybr.com</em> gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with
        <em>keybr.com</em> are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and
        financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, <em>keybr.com</em>
        collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose
        of the visitors interaction with <em>keybr.com</em>.
        <em>keybr.com</em> does not disclose personally&ndash;identifying information other than as described below.
        And visitors can always refuse to supply personally&ndash;identifying information, with the caveat that
        it may prevent them from engaging in certain website&ndash;related activities.</p>

      <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

      <p><em>keybr.com</em> may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance,
        <em>keybr.com</em> may monitor the most popular pages on this site. <em>keybr.com</em> may display this
        information publicly or provide it to others. However, <em>keybr.com</em> does not disclose
        personally&ndash;identifying information other than as described below.</p>

      <h3>Protection of Certain Personally&ndash;Identifying Information</h3>

      <p><em>keybr.com</em> discloses potentially personally&ndash;identifying and personally&ndash;identifying
        information only to
        those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order
        to process it on <em>keybr.com</em>s behalf or to provide services available at <em>keybr.com</em>s websites,
        and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
        organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using <em>keybr.com&rsquo;s</em> websites, you
        consent to the transfer of such information to them. <em>keybr.com</em> will not rent or sell potentially
        personally&ndash;identifying and personally&ndash;identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
        employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, <em>keybr.com</em> discloses
        potentially personally&ndash;identifying and personally&ndash;identifying information only when required
        to do so by law, or when <em>keybr.com</em> believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary
        to protect the property or rights of <em>keybr.com</em>, third parties or the public at large. If you are
        a registered user of an <em>keybr.com</em> website and have supplied your email address, <em>keybr.com</em>
        may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback,
        or just keep you up to date with whats going on with <em>keybr.com</em> and our products.
        We primarily use our website to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep
        this type of email to a minimum. <em>keybr.com</em> takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect
        against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally&ndash;identifying
        and personally&ndash;identifying information.</p>

      <h3>Cookies</h3>

      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitors computer, and that the visitors browser
        provides to the website each time the visitor returns. <em>keybr.com</em> uses cookies to help
        <em>keybr.com</em> identify and track visitors, their usage of <em>keybr.com</em> website, and their website
        access preferences. <em>keybr.com</em> visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should
        set their browsers to refuse cookies before using <em>keybr.com</em>s websites, with the drawback that certain
        features of <em>keybr.com&rsquo;s</em> websites may not function properly, or you may not be granted access to
        parts of the website, without the aid of cookies.</p>

      <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, <em>keybr.com</em> may change its Privacy Policy from time to time,
        and in <em>keybr.com&rsquo;s</em> sole discretion. <em>keybr.com</em> encourages visitors to frequently check
        this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this
        Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
