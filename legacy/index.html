<p>Have you ever wished that you had a way to practice typing so that you could become a more efficient and capable keyboard jockey? Typing at the “speed of thought,”perhaps? Enter Keybr.com — the flash–based typing instructor you’vebeen waiting for!</p>
<p>Keybr.com is very straightforward. You can choose from three basic lessons that start with a certain number of keys on the keyboard, and then, as you progress through the lessons, more keys are introduced to the mix to make things a little tougher. As an added bonus, our software keeps track of all your mistakes and your words–per–minute(wpm) — and even creates graphs of your day–by–day performance.</p>
<p>But, things get even better! Once you have determined that the lessons you have completed have reached their maximum result, get ready to play with custom mode, where you can edit and personalize the text that you wish to practice! Very bare–bones, but oh,so functional.</p>
<p>Finally, to up the entertainment level of your typing lessons, you can import content from a web site or blog into Keybr.com to type it out.</p>
<p>But why even bother to learn touch typing? The answer is simple — it is healthier for you, faster and more accurate. Blogging, writing long documents and e–mails,instant messaging with your friends, and even coding sophisticated computer programs will become much easier and more enjoyable once you eliminate distraction of hunt–and–peck typing.</p>
<p>How long would it take for you to develop a good typing speed? It would probably take you weeks to polish your skills up to a top level, but really decent speed can be achieved in a matter of hours with daily training. We promise that we can teach you to type at a speed of above 50 words per minute in less than ten hours with our course. And who wouldn’t benefit from that?</p>
<p>How does Keybr.com work?</p>
<p>Unlike much of the teaching typing software available out there, Keybr.com does not force you to type random characters over and over again; that is simply boring and contributes very little to your learning. Instead, Keybr.com generates readable random words using the phonetic rules of your native language. These words look almost natural, and often they really are. Typing sensible text is much easier than random letters, and it helps you to remember frequent key combinations. For example, it’s almost impossible for the letter ‘W’ to follow the ‘Z’ in English, and you will never type this combination in Keybr.com. Instead, you will type more common words, such as “the,” “that,” “with,” and so on. Keybr.com lets you introduce as few keys as possible to the lesson, adding more keys later when you feel that you are competent and fast enough on the current level. So, if you start with the keys from the Caps Lock row, then add keys form the Tab row, and then from the Shift row, you will eventually end up typing real text with capital letters and punctuation.</p>
<p>Keybr.com is a web–based software that runs directly in your browser. You don’t have to download or install anything! The most recent and up–to–date version is always with you. You can use it from any computer connected to the Internet, and your typing statistics are kept on the web site and available on–demand.</p></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="pull-right">Send your comments and suggestions to <a href="mailto:info@keybr.com">info@keybr.com</a> | <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/keybr" target="forum">Public Forum</a><br>Copyright &copy; 2017 keybr.com | <a href="/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> | <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></div></div></div></body></html>
